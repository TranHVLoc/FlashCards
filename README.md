This web app: **An update of FlashCard project in which the user can enter their guess to check if the answer is correct or wrong**

Time spent: **3.5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The user can enter their guess in a box before seeing the flipside of the card**
- [x] **Clicking on a submit button shows visual feedback about whether the answer was correct or incorrect**
- [x] **A back button is displayed on the card and can be used to return to the previous card in a set sequence**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] A shuffle button is used to randomize the order of the cards

## Notes

The most difficult challenge run into during building this additional feature is illustrating how the answer form will operate that it can handle input from user as well as passing that input to a function to check its correctness. Also, the `streak` and `maxStreak` variables did not update synchronously, which cost me an amount of time trying to figure out how to update them simultaneously by ***callback*** function. Thanks to the lab provided for this unit, I successfully finished the project by a huge concept and intuition borrow from it
