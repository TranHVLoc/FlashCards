## Notes

The hardest challenge encountered while building the app is trying to display only one card at a time and proceed to next card when a button is hit. Also, even if the goal has been accomplised, there was still a problem where the next cards don't flip back to the front. This was when a little configuration should be done so as all the cards could flip back to the question state when the user chooses next card.
